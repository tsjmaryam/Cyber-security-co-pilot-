# Cyber-security-co-pilot

CloudTrail normalization pipeline for the flaws.cloud dataset.

## Run

From the project root:

```bash
python -m src.main --project-root .
```

To increase log detail during integration/debugging:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python -m src.main --project-root .
```

To generate the purpose-doc demo stream with synthetic CloudTrail batches for the blind-spot scenarios:

```bash
python -m src.demo_stream --output-dir data/demo_stream --batch-size 1
```

To run the current pipeline against the purpose-doc demo scenarios end to end:

```bash
python -m src.demo_runner --project-root . --output-dir data/demo_run --batch-size 1
```

To generate weak suspiciousness labels on incidents and train the baseline incident model:

```bash
python -m src.train_model --project-root .
```

To use the FraudLens-style cyber adapter for single-incident explanation:

```bash
python -m src.cyber_fraudlens_adapter --project-root . --incident-id incident_000000001
```

To score a batch of incidents through the same adapter:

```bash
python -m src.cyber_fraudlens_adapter --project-root . --output data/processed/incidents_adapter_scored.parquet
```

To generate non-expert-facing decision support for a scored incident:

```bash
python -c "from src.decision_support_bridge import generate_decision_support_for_incident; import json; print(json.dumps(generate_decision_support_for_incident('incident_000000001', project_root='.'), indent=2))"
```

To use the Postgres-ready application layer, create the schema from [`src/db/schema.sql`](C:/Users/ejtal/Downloads/judgment_drift/Cyber-security-co-pilot/src/db/schema.sql), store incident context, evidence packages, detector results, coverage assessments, and policy snapshots, then call the app service around the pure `decision_support` package.

To build the operator-facing coverage review object that emphasizes blind spots and double-check paths:

```bash
python -c "from src.services.coverage_review_service import CoverageReviewAppService; print('Use CoverageReviewAppService with the Postgres repository bundle to assemble operator review payloads.')"
```

To record the human decision and audit trail after review:

```bash
python -c "from src.services.operator_decision_service import OperatorDecisionAppService; print('Use OperatorDecisionAppService to record approved recommendations, alternative choices, escalations, and double-check requests.')"
```

To query the new model-agnostic agent against a Postgres-backed incident using any OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint:

```bash
python -c "from src.services.agent_app_service import query_incident_agent; import json; print(json.dumps(query_incident_agent('incident_000000001', 'What should I do next?', env={'POSTGRES_DSN':'postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/cyber', 'OPENAI_MODEL':'gpt-4.1-mini', 'OPENAI_BASE_URL':'https://your-endpoint.example/v1', 'OPENAI_API_KEY':'token'}), indent=2))"
```

The agent is model-agnostic at the application boundary and now uses a bounded ReAct loop:
- it loads incident context, evidence packages, detector outputs, coverage state, and prior decision-support results from Postgres
- it lets the model choose among grounded tools such as `load_incident`, `load_detector_result`, `load_coverage_assessment`, `load_decision_support`, and `generate_decision_support`
- it generates decision support on demand if the database does not already have one
- it sends a standard OpenAI-style `chat/completions` request to the configured endpoint
- it limits reasoning to `AGENT_MAX_REASONING_STEPS` to keep execution bounded and auditable

For local testing, the agent can also reuse the Codex desktop auth token instead of a normal API key:

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4.1-mini"
$env:AGENT_USE_CODEX_AUTH="1"
```

Notes:
- this reads the access token from `~/.codex/auth.json`
- it is intended for local testing only
- it is only supported against `https://api.openai.com/v1`
- for any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` normally

Default config lives in `configs/pipeline_config.yaml` and behavioral flag rules live in `configs/event_flag_rules.yaml`.

## Structure

- `src/ingest.py`: scans input files and tar archives, parses CloudTrail payloads, and preserves provenance
- `src/normalize.py`: flattens CloudTrail records into a canonical event table
- `src/derive_features.py`: adds ordering keys, convenience flags, missingness states, and rolling counts
- `src/build_incidents.py`: groups ordered events into inactivity-bounded incidents
- `src/demo_stream.py`: generates synthetic CloudTrail-style demo scenarios for incomplete, complete, and unavailable-context operator flows
- `src/demo_runner.py`: runs the existing ingestion, normalization, feature, incident, weak-label, decision-support, and coverage-review flow over the demo scenarios
- `src/validate.py`: builds schema metadata and validation summaries
